# Elm game base

Example base for a game in Elm 0.19.

This codebase is made for [an article](http://ohanhi.github.io/base-for-game-elm-017.html). The main file here is [Game.elm](Game.elm).

To get things up and running, you will need `npm` installed. Then clone this repository and navigate to the directory. The following commands should work for you even if you have a previous version of Elm installed globally:

```bash
› npm install
› npx elm reactor
```

Then you can point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/Game.elm](http://localhost:8000/Game.elm) and try it out (arrows left/right and spacebar to control).
